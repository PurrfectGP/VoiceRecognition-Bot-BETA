# VoiceRecognition-Bot-BETA
I learnt how to create my own Google Assistant with some basic code and i am currently learning to use this in more complex ways

In order for the bot to be fully functioning you will need to install these libaries

For the Bot to be able recognise and listen to our voice use pip install speechRecognition

To speak out, or text to speech use pip install pyttsx3

For advance control on browser use pip install pywhatkit

To get wikipedia data use pip install wikipedia

To get funny jokes use pip install pyjokes

I will be testing and experimenting with this in future projects and hopefully ill be to add it to a VR concept i have been eager to try and develop
